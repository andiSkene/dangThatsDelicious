## What is this?

This is a website created to run on node, with a no sql database in mongodb. I created this using the Wes Bos Tutorial, it was super fun, and I hope to make some more in the future. Unfortunately this tutorial was not without it's bugs. :(

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

|Name|Email (login)|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Wes Bos|wes@example.com|wes|
|Debbie Downer|debbie@example.com|debbie|
|Beau|beau@example.com|beau|
